# Blog Platform with Flask

This project is a Flask-powered blog platform that fetches articles from an external API, stores them locally in a JSON file, and displays them on various pages of the application. It also includes a contact form where users can submit their information, which is then sent via email using a custom SMTP setup.

## Features

- **Dynamic Article Fetching and Display**: Articles are fetched from an external API and stored locally, then dynamically displayed on the home and individual post pages.
- **Random Post Feature**: A random post is selected and displayed on different pages to engage users with varied content.
- **Contact Form**: A contact form is available for users to submit their details, which are then sent to a specified email address via SMTP.
- **Styling with Static Files**: The application uses Flask's `url_for` to include CSS and JavaScript files for styling and interactivity.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**: The backend is built with Python, using Flask as the web framework.
- **Flask**: A lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python, used to handle requests and responses.
- **JSON**: Used for storing and parsing data fetched from the external API.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Used for the frontend to create an engaging and interactive user experience.
- **SMTP**: Used for sending emails with user-submitted data from the contact form.
